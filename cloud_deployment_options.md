## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Modular Architecture
- Break the application into smaller components
- Optimize each component for deployment constraints
- Use lightweight dependencies where possible

### 2. Serverless Approach
- Design stateless components where possible
- Utilize browser local storage for user data
- Implement efficient caching strategies

### 3. LLM Optimization
- Use quantized models (4-bit or 8-bit) to reduce memory requirements
- Implement efficient prompt engineering
- Utilize Hugging Face's inference endpoints

### 4. Data Storage Strategy
- Use browser local storage for user preferences
- Implement file-based storage for financial data
- Utilize GitHub repository for storing static knowledge base

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare the Application
- Organize code into a GitHub repository
- Create a requirements.txt file with all dependencies
- Add a README with setup instructions
- Include necessary configuration files

### 2. Set Up Hugging Face Space
- Create a new Space with Streamlit SDK
- Connect to the GitHub repository
- Configure environment variables for API keys
- Set up the Space with appropriate hardware resources

### 3. Deploy the Application
- Push code to the GitHub repository
- Trigger deployment on Hugging Face Spaces
- Monitor the build and deployment process
- Test the deployed application

### 4. Configure Custom Domain (Optional)
- Set up a custom domain in Hugging Face Spaces settings
